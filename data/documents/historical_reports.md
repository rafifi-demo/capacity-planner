### 2.2 Load Factor Analysis

Average load factors by route type:
- Domestic trunk (JFK, ORD, LAX): 72%
- Domestic regional: 58%
- Trans-Pacific (NRT, HKG): 81%
- Trans-Atlantic (LHR, FRA): 75%

### 2.3 Opportunities Identified

Low utilization areas requiring attention:
1. Denver route: 45% load factor - consider consolidation
2. Phoenix route: 52% load factor - evaluate frequency
3. Weekend operations: 15% below weekday average

## Section 3: Route Performance

### 3.1 Top Performing Routes

| Route | Revenue/kg | Margin | Recommendation |
|-------|------------|--------|----------------|
| SEA-NRT | $4.85 | 28% | Maintain frequency |
| SEA-HKG | $5.12 | 26% | Add capacity |
| SEA-LHR | $4.21 | 22% | Maintain |
| SEA-JFK | $2.45 | 18% | Optimize timing |

### 3.2 Underperforming Routes

| Route | Revenue/kg | Margin | Action Taken |
|-------|------------|--------|--------------|
| SEA-DEN | $1.85 | 8% | Reduced frequency |
| SEA-PHX | $1.92 | 10% | Under review |
| SEA-SIN | $4.02 | 12% | Cost reduction |

### 3.3 Route Optimization Results

**SEA-NRT Route Optimization (October 2025):**
- Optimal departure time: 2300 local (arrival 0600+1 NRT)
- Fuel savings: 3% achieved with higher altitude cruise
- Recommendation: Combine with SEA-HKG cargo when volume permits

**European Consolidation:**
- Combined SEA-LHR and SEA-FRA cargo onto single 747 rotation
- Resulted in 18% cost reduction per kg
- Customer transit time improved by 4 hours average

## Section 4: Lessons Learned

### 4.1 Holiday Peak Season

Key lessons from November-December 2025:

1. **Begin capacity ramp-up 2 weeks before projected peak**
   - We started 1 week late in 2025
   - Lost approximately $450K in opportunity cost
   - Recommendation: Begin ramp-up October 15 for 2026

2. **Pre-position aircraft at secondary hubs**
   - Repositioning flights cost $85K during peak
   - Pre-positioning would have saved $60K
   - Implement for Q4 2026

3. **Cross-train crew on multiple aircraft types**
   - Crew shortages limited 767 utilization
   - 5 pilots completed cross-training in Q4
   - Goal: 80% of FOs qualified on 2+ types

4. **Maintain 15% capacity buffer for unexpected demand**
   - Buffer was exhausted by December 15
   - Charter costs of $125K incurred
   - Increase buffer to 20% for December 2026

### 4.2 Operational Challenges

Issues encountered and solutions:

| Challenge | Impact | Solution Implemented |
|-----------|--------|---------------------|
| Crew duty limit constraints | 12 delayed flights | Added reserve pool |
| Maintenance overrun (N768ZV) | 18 days out of service | Accelerated A-check |
| Weather delays SEA | 45 diversions | Added 4-hour buffer |
| Customs delays NRT | 8-hour average | Pre-clearance program |

### 4.3 Cost Management

Cost savings initiatives:

- Fuel hedging program: Saved $890K vs spot market
- Crew optimization software: Reduced overtime 22%
- Ground handling renegotiation: 8% cost reduction
- Insurance review: 12% premium reduction
