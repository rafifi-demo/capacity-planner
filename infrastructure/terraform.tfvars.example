# Authentication Notes
# =============================================================================
# This deployment uses Azure AD Managed Identity for PostgreSQL authentication.
#
# After terraform apply:
# 1. Container Apps have System-Assigned Managed Identity enabled
# 2. PostgreSQL has Microsoft Entra authentication enabled
# 3. Run data/create_managed_identity_user.sql to create database roles
#
# The password above is kept as a fallback and for initial database seeding.
